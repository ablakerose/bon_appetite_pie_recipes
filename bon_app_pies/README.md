# BonAppPies

Welcome to the BonAppPies gem! This Gem allows you to view several pie recipes directly from the Bon Appetit website. Once a pie is selected, you can read a description, see ingredients and follow a recipe description. You may then see a list anew and find a new recipe or exit the program.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'bon_app_pies'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bon_app_pies

$ bon_app_pies

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
